Developers can create their own games and animations using the Pico Game Engine. The compiled examples use default input and board configurations.

### Installing Compiled Examples
There are two installation methods; choose the one that is most convenient for you:

**Universal Method**
1. Download one of the examples from the `builds/Games` directory.
2. Press and hold the `BOOT` button on your device for 2 seconds.
3. While holding the `BOOT` button, connect the device to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Drag and drop the downloaded file onto the device. It will automatically reboot and begin running the example.

**Video Game Module (Only)**
1. Install the Video Game Module Tool app on your Flipper Zero from the Apps catalog: [Video Game Module Tool](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/video_game_module_tool).

3. Disconnect your Video Game Module from your Flipper and connect your Flipper to your computer.

7. Disconnect your Flipper from your computer, then turn it off.
8. Connect your Video Game Module to your Flipper, then turn your Flipper on.
