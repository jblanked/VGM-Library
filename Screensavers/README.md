## Screensavers
The current screensavers are compiled examples from the [PicoDVI-Adafruit Fork](https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/picodvi-adafruit-fork/), edited and adapted for the Video Game Module.

### Installation
1. Download your preferred screensaver.
2. Press and hold the `BOOT` button on your Video Game Module for 2 seconds.
3. While holding the `BOOT` button, connect the Video Game Module to your computer via USB. A new device named `RPI-RP2` should appear in your device list.
4. Drag and drop the downloaded file onto the device. The device will automatically disconnect after the file transfer completes. Connect your HDMI display and power on your Video Game Module to view the screensaver.
